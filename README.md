# AVR Projects

*This repository contains some of my old AVR projects.*

Most are in C, to be compiled with `avr-gcc`. There's always a `Makefile` that should take care of it.

## Hardware

Some projects are for `ATtiny13` or `ATtiny2313`, some bigger ones are for *Arduino Pro Mini*,
but in plain C, not the ugly Arduino C/C++ hybrid.

I use the Arduino Pro Mini, because it's the cheapest way to get an `ATmega238P`, already with
a nice breakout board, crystal and everything. They can be purchased on eBay for under $3 (USD)!

## Repo contents

- Old, not too useful projects are in **archive/**
- Good and finished projects are in **projects/**
- Library has been **moved to [it's own repo](https://github.com/MightyPork/avr-lib)**.

Feel free to use any of my code :o)
