Snake for HD44780
=================

This is a Snake game (known from old Nokia phones) played on a character display with HD44780.

Program tested on Arduino Pro Mini (flashed with avrdude using the Makefile).

**Connections** are `#define`d in `main.c`, board size and snake speed can also be adjusted. No external parts except the display and buttons required.

Best works with a gamepad, but any buttons will work.
