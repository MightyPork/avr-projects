AVR utils library
=================

This is my ever-evolving library (not only) for AVR programming.

When I'm done with a project, I copy the current library to the project, so it doesn't break when I do further improvements.

Each library file contains a large comment block explaining it's function.

You may need to add "c" files to your makefile for some of the library files.
